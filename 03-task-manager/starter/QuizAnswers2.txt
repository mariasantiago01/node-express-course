1. In this lesson, you created a middleware function called asyncWrapper. Why?
    Because it's tidies up the code by allowing the middleware function to be called for each controller, 
    as opposed to repeatedly adding the same lengthy try-catch blocks with the same information.

2. Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and and error message 
are send back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. 
Assume that you’ve created a CustomAPIError class and an error handler that references 
that class. Complete the code:
    const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {
        const { id: taskID } = req.params;
        const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });
        if (!task) {
            // your code here
            return next(customErrorHandler(`No task with id:  ${ taskID }`, 404))
        }
        res.status(200).json({ task });
    });
